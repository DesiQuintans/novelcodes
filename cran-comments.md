Hope you had a good CRAN vacation! I have resubmitted with these changes:

1. All external links in the package were checked and fixed if needed.

Thank you for your feedback. I have resubmitted with these changes:

1. Description was proof-read with minor changes to wording.
2. There is no paper (yet) to reference for this package's methods. It will be added to the Description when it is in press.
3. 'LICENSE' changed to only contain year and copyright holders.
4. All external links in the package were checked and fixed if needed.

1. Examples for these functions are wrapped in \donttest{} because they write to the file system: save_last_plot() and create_field_notes_template().

Thank you for your time!
