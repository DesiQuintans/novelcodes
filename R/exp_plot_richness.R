#' Plot novelty of interview codes over time
#'
#' The full definition of novel and duplicate codes is in [score_codes()].
#' Briefly, 'novel' codes are topics/ideas/concepts that were not mentioned in
#' previous interviews, whereas 'duplicate' codes are topics that other
#' interviews have discussed previously.
#'
#' This plot complements [plot_novelty()] by visualising the richness of each
#' interview in terms of novel and duplicate codes, in context with any
#' refinements to interview questions that were made (marked by stars underneath
#' each bar). By examining this plot together with their field notes, researchers
#' can get insight into the effects of their refinements and the richness of the
#' data.
#'
#' @param score_df (Dataframe) A dataframe of scored codes, as generated by [score_codes()].
#' @param refinements (Integer) A vector that lists when (in terms of interview
#'    sequence) refinements were made to the interview questions. For example,
#'    `c(10, 15)` means that interview questions were revised twice: First **before**
#'    the 10th interview, and then again **before** the 15th interview.
#'
#' @return A ggplot object.
