Description: In semi-structured interviews that are analysed using the
    'framework' method, it is not always clear how refinements to interview
    questions affect the decision of when to stop interviews. The trend of
    'novel' and 'duplicate' interview codes (novel codes are information that
    has not been previously mentioned by other interviewees) provides insight
    into the richness of qualitative information. This package provides tools
    to visualise when refinements occur and how that affects the trends of
    novel and duplicate codes. These visualisations, when used progressively when
    new interviews are finished, can help the researcher decide on a stopping
    point for their interviews.
